# Fukuro 🦉

A personal Android client for [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/), built for sideloading.

## Features

- **Streaming + background playback** — Media3/ExoPlayer foreground service with notification & lock-screen controls (−10 s / +30 s instead of prev/next)
- **Android Auto** — browse *Continue Listening*, *Downloaded* and *Library* from the car screen
- **Offline downloads** — books stored on-device; playable with no server connection, including in Android Auto
- **Progress sync** — position syncs to the server every 15 s and on pause; resumes anywhere; cached locally when offline
- **Series & authors** — real series grouping from the server, author portraits, tap through to a grid of their books
- **Chapters** — collapsible chapter list in the player, current chapter always visible, tap to seek
- **Favorites** — heart any book (stored on-device) and get a Favorites shelf
- **Recommendations** — discover books through Open Library, optionally enriched by Google Books, using your authors, tags, genres, favorites and listening history; open an in-app page for synopsis and tags
- **Mark finished / reset progress / rename** — per book, synced to the server
- **Upload books** — add an Audiobookshelf API key in Settings, then upload audio files straight from the phone
- **Sleep timer & playback speed** — bottom sheets with presets plus custom values (speed up to 10×)
- **Customizable home screen** — toggle and reorder shelves, including Recommendations, Continue Listening, Favorites, Downloaded, Series, Authors, and All Books
- **Theming** — light / dark / system, eight accent colors (default: Fukuro orange) or Material You
- **Server connection indicator** — green/red dot in the top bar
- **Listening statistics** — period summaries and charts, listening habits, completed-book
  highlights, five meaningful recent sessions, and a shareable year-in-review card
- **Local listening history** — Fukuro records elapsed playback time on-device and combines it
  with Audiobookshelf history, including offline and on-device books

## Project layout

Everything lives in one flat `fukuro` package — no deep `com/example/...` nesting, no sub-packages:

```
build.gradle.kts          plugin versions
settings.gradle.kts       repositories
app/build.gradle.kts      android config + all dependencies

## Building

Requirements: JDK 17, Android SDK (platform 35, build-tools 35).

```
gradle assembleDebug
```

APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`. Prebuilt APKs are attached to each
[release](../../releases) — download one on the phone and open it to install.

## Publishing a release

Pushing a version tag such as `v1.10.7` automatically builds a signed release APK, creates the
matching GitHub Release, and attaches the APK and its SHA-256 checksum. Before tagging the first
release, add these repository Actions secrets under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` — the release keystore encoded as Base64
- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` — the keystore password
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` — the signing key alias
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` — the signing key password

Keep the keystore and its passwords backed up. All future APKs must use the same signing key in
order to install as updates. To encode a keystore in PowerShell, run:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("fukuro-release.jks")) |
    Set-Clipboard
```

Debug builds use the `nl.codefin.fukuro.glassdev` application ID and the name **Fukuro Test**,
so they update the test installation without replacing the published app.

## First run

1. Open the app and enter your Audiobookshelf server URL (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:13378`).
2. Log in with your Audiobookshelf username/password.
3. Cleartext HTTP is enabled for LAN use; for access outside your home network put the server behind
   HTTPS (reverse proxy) or use a VPN.

## Notes

- Debug-signed: fine for personal sideloading; new builds update **Fukuro Test** and keep its data.
- Android Auto with sideloaded apps: in the Android Auto app, enable *Developer settings → Unknown sources*.
- Favorites are stored on the device (Audiobookshelf has no favorites concept), so they don't appear in the web UI.
